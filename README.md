# Haskell-proyects-and-exercices.
During my second year of university i learned haskell. It has provided me with a lot of useful tools, and changed the way i look at problems. 
Here i present one group proyect, about 2 different types of encryption and decryption systems (Cesar and Vigenere), as well as some suggested exercises mainly focusing on recursion.
Almost everything is commented in spanish, if you are intrested in knowing more about the topics or how i thought about the problems in english, you can contact me in: echavemendezm@gmail.com
