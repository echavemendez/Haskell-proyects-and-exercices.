# Haskell-proyects-and-exercices.
During my second year of university i learned haskell, it has provided me with a lot of useful tool, and changed the way i look at problems. 
Here i present one group proyect, about 2 different types of encryption and decryption systems (Cesar, and Vigenere), as well as some suggested exercises.
